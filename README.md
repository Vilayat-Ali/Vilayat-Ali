### 🧠 Profile

Senior engineer with 5+ years of experience architecting and building robust systems across the entire stack. I specialize in the intersection of **high-performance systems engineering** and **production-grade machine learning**, with expertise spanning distributed systems, scalable infrastructure, and end-to-end ML platforms.

My technical approach emphasizes **clean architecture**, **performance optimization**, and **maintainable code** across multiple domains. I leverage **Rust** for systems programming, **Go** for concurrent services, **TypeScript** for web applications, and **Python** for data-intensive workloads and machine learning.

Beyond production systems, I maintain a deep interest in **programming language design** and **compiler construction**—pursuits that continuously refine my understanding of computational fundamentals and system design principles.
